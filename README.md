# Stream Deck With LED Strip

I upgraded my DIY Stream Deck (Idea from @DaveM , please see [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2822140 "Thingiverse")) with an LED bar because I wanted to visually see if I was currently muted in my home office conferences. I slightly modified Dave's code that the LED turns green (unmute) and red (mute) when a specific button is pressed. All you have to do is connect the LED to the Arduino (no external power source needed) to the following PINS:
